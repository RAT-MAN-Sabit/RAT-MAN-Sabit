## 🧬 About Me

I'm **Sabit**, an **ethical developer** with a taste for the dark side of code—used **legally**. I specialize in:

- ⚔️ Developing powerful, stealthy RATs for research & simulation  
- 🧠 Building malware for ethical red-teaming and educational labs  
- 🔍 Security testing, CTFs, and automation tools  

> I don't build tools for crime. I build them to **prepare you for it.**

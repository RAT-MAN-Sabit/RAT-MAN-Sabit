## 🧠 Who Am I?

Welcome, wanderer. You’ve just stumbled upon the digital profile of an **ethically dangerous** individual. I don't hack for chaos. I hack to expose the holes others fear to find.

I'm a cybersecurity researcher and offensive security developer who builds, breaks, and educates. I specialize in simulating real-world malware behavior (like Remote Access Trojans, droppers, binders, and stealth tools)—**not for harm, but for knowledge and defense**.

🔐 **Legally lethal. Digitally ethical. Always educational.**

## 🧨 What I Do

✅ **Ethical Malware Development**  
Crafting fully custom, educational Remote Access Tools and post-exploitation payloads for research in isolated environments.

✅ **Red Team Simulation**  
Creating offensive scenarios to test detection systems, build resilient defenses, and educate SOC teams.

✅ **EDR/AV Evasion Labs**  
Studying detection systems to create educational bypass techniques—always in lab settings with strict safety protocols.

✅ **Reverse Engineering & Payload Analysis**  
Tearing apart malicious binaries to understand tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world attackers.

✅ **Educator & Mentor**  
Sharing knowledge with upcoming ethical hackers through writeups, open-source labs, and simulated RAT frameworks.

## 🔒 Philosophy

> _“You can't defend what you don't understand.”_

- I believe in weaponizing knowledge—not systems.
- Every payload I build has a lesson behind it.
- My labs simulate black hat behavior to train white hats.
- **Everything I do is legal, controlled, and with purpose.**
